## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built as a single-page application (SPA) using vanilla JavaScript with Bootstrap 5 for responsive design. This approach offers a balance of performance and simplicity while maintaining cross-browser compatibility.

#### Key Frontend Components:

1. **UI Layer**: Bootstrap 5 components provide a responsive and modern interface
2. **Application Logic**: Modular JavaScript organized in the `gasManager` object
3. **Data Capture**: Camera integration via MediaDevices API
4. **Image Processing**: OCR capabilities through Tesseract.js
5. **Notification System**: User feedback via Toastify.js
6. **Local Storage**: Caching of data for offline operations and performance

#### JavaScript Organization:

The frontend logic is encapsulated in a comprehensive JavaScript module (`gas_manager.js`), which follows an object-oriented pattern. All functionality is contained within the `gasManager` object, which provides:

- Data storage for cylinders and history
- Camera control and image processing
- User interface initialization and event handling
- Data synchronization with the server
- Form validation and error handling

### Backend Architecture

The backend is implemented as a lightweight Flask application that serves the static frontend assets and provides RESTful API endpoints for data operations.

#### Key Backend Components:

1. **Web Server**: Flask application with CORS support
2. **API Endpoints**: RESTful services for data operations
3. **File Storage**: JSON-based data persistence
4. **Report Generation**: CSV export functionality
5. **Security Layer**: HTTPS implementation with SSL certificates

#### Data Flow:

1. Client loads the SPA from the Flask server
2. Local storage is initialized with data from the server (if available)
3. User interactions trigger JavaScript functions
4. Data changes are persisted to local storage and synchronized with the server
5. Reports and exports are generated server-side and downloaded by the client

### Data Model

The application uses a simple but effective data model with two main entities:

#### Cylinder Object
```javascript
{
  code: "7563110001",       // Unique cylinder identifier
  gasType: "N2",            // Type of gas contained
  pressure: 200,            // Pressure in bar
  physicalForm: "gas",      // Physical state (gas, liquid, etc.)
  entryDate: "2023-05-20T14:30:00.000Z"  // ISO timestamp of entry
}
```

#### History Record Object
```javascript
{
  code: "7563110001",       // Cylinder identifier
  gasType: "N2",            // Type of gas
  pressureIn: 200,          // Initial pressure
  pressureOut: 40,          // Remaining pressure at return
  entryDate: "2023-05-20T14:30:00.000Z",  // Entry timestamp
  exitDate: "2023-06-15T09:45:00.000Z"    // Exit timestamp
}
```

## Installation Guide

### System Requirements

- **Server Requirements**:
  - Python 3.7 or higher
  - 1GB RAM minimum (2GB recommended)

  - Modern web browser (Chrome 83+, Firefox 78+, Safari 14+, Edge 84+)
  - Camera access for OCR functionality
  - JavaScript enabled
  - 1280Ã—720 display resolution or higher (recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download the repository**
   ```bash

## Recent Updates

### June 2025 Updates

#### Enhanced Consumption Reporting

The gas consumption calculation has been improved to provide more accurate volume metrics:

- **Direct Volume Calculation**: Gas consumption is now calculated using the formula `consumed_liters = (pressure_difference * cylinder_volume)`, which directly measures the volume of gas consumed
- **Improved Reporting**: The "RIEPILOGO CONSUMO PER TIPO DI GAS" (Gas Consumption Summary) section in reports now clearly displays both pressure consumption (bar) and volume consumption (liters)
- **Total Consumption Metrics**: Reports now include totals for both pressure and volume consumption across all gas types

#### Report Generation Improvements

- **Comprehensive Reports**: The "Report Completo" (Complete Report) feature now generates more detailed analyses including stock status, gas type distribution, and consumption patterns
- **CSV Format Optimization**: Improved CSV formatting for better compatibility with Excel and other data analysis tools
- **Data Validation**: Enhanced validation of consumption calculations for more reliable reporting

### English Translation Guide

To translate the application interface and reporting to English, follow these steps:

#### Translating the User Interface

1. **HTML Translation**:
   - Open `gas.html` and replace Italian text with English equivalents
   - Translate button labels, form fields, and section headers
   - Maintain all HTML attributes and structure

2. **JavaScript Translation**:
   - Open `gas_manager.js` and translate user-facing messages
   - Update notification texts in the `showNotification` function calls
   - Translate validation messages and alerts

#### Translating Reports

1. **Report Headers**:
   - In `app.py`, find the `export_all`, `export_stock`, and `export_history` functions
   - Translate CSV headers and section titles from Italian to English

2. **Function Names**:
   - Consider updating function names to reflect English terminology
   - Update corresponding JavaScript function calls if necessary

3. **Date Formatting**:
   - The `format_date` function can be updated to use English date formatting if desired (MM/DD/YYYY instead of DD/MM/YYYY)
